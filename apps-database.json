Consequently, they can be used also as a host intrusion detection mechanism.\n\nThe tools rely on specialised external security tools such as John the Ripper, Chkroot and integrity check tools (like Tripwire, Integrit or Aide) for some of the tasks. The periodic review mechanism relies on the use of the cron task scheduler and an email delivery system.\n\nTIGER has one primary goal: report ways the system's security can be compromised.\n\nDebian's TIGER incorporates new checks primarily oriented towards Debian distribution including: md5sums checks of installed files, location of files not belonging to packages, check of security advisories and analysis of local listening processes.\n\nThis package provides all the security scripts and data files.",

Searches can be performed both in the tree view and the playlist.\n\nOther features include:\n\n* DBus interface for controlling the player and retrieving the\n  currently played track, among other things\n* alter the playing order in the playlist by queueing tracks;\n  stop after a certain track; repeat track or playlist; random mode;\n  undo and redo\n* reading of tags when adding to the playlist can be disabled by\n  specifying a regular expression to extract them from the filename\n* submission of played songs to Last.fm\n* global shortcuts\nMinirok is written using the PyKDE bindings and the GStreamer media framework.",

It can also interface with computer Go programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. The qGo homepage can be found at http://qgo.sourceforge.net/. Have a look at the cgoban package if you are interested in a Go client with less package dependencies.\n\nGo is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).\n\nIn this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.\n\nThe game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.\n\nCompared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.\n\n(adopted from http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)",

Any interface supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many others.\n\nArdour has support for 24 bit samples using floating point internally, non-linear editing with unlimited undo, a user-configurable mixer, MTC master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware control surface compatibility.\n\nIt supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller and many modern digital mixers.\n\nArdour contains a powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is completely non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select, cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can save independent \"versions\" of a track or an entire piece\n\nArdour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another strip.\n\nArdour's channel capacity is limited only by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk subsystem to stream the data back and forth.\n\nJACK (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications and/or hardware audio interfaces.\n\nArdour is sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits, and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE floating point format.\n\nFurther information can be found at <http://ardour.org/>.",

To achieve this you will need to explore numerous dungeon levels, defeat many foes and sift through a great deal of treasure.\n\nAngband is a reference to Morgoth's \"prison of iron\" in the world of Middle-Earth, created by J.R.R.

It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.\n\nThe design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages: Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.\n\nThe core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.\n\nAdditionally, over two thousand extension \"packages\" are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages, named 'r-cran-<name>'.\n\nThis package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.",

Each version of each program is stored in its own sub-directory within the Zero Install cache (nothing is installed to directories outside of the cache, such as /usr/bin) and no code from the package is run during install or uninstall.

It is often described as a \"roguelike\" game because the look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or less continuous development since the early 1990s.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so, you will receive the exalted status of \"winner\" and your character may retire. To achieve this you will need to explore numerous dungeon levels, defeat many foes and sift through a great deal of treasure.\n\nAngband is a reference to Morgoth's \"prison of iron\" in the world of Middle-Earth, created by J.R.R. Tolkein.",

First an amazon moves to a new square and then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a straight line in any direction from the square the amazon landed on). The square the arrow lands on becomes a permenant block for the rest of the game. No one can move over it, or fire an arrow over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an arrow, so every turn there is one less square available on the board.

Rather than attempting to write a set of development tools  of its own, Pida uses tools that the developer has available. In this regards Pida can be used as a framework for putting together your own bespoke IDE.\n\nAlthough still a young application, Pida can already boast a huge number of features because of the power of some of the tools it integrates. For example features such as code completion and syntax highlighting are well implemented in Pida's integrated editors far better than any editor built for a commercial IDE. Pida currently features: Full code editing (syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic indenting, block commenting etc) Project management, version control management, Python debugger and profiler, GTK+ graphical user interface building and rapid application design, Pastebin integration.",

It can perform many image manipulation tasks much faster than other packages such as ImageMagick and the GIMP and includes some special features such as creating single \"mosaic\" images from multiple parts.\n\nVIPS consists of two main components: an image processing library with some command-line tools and a spreadsheet-like graphical user interface.  This package supplies the graphical interface.\n\nWith nip2, rather than directly editing images, you build relationships between objects in a spreadsheet-like fashion.  When you make a change somewhere, nip2 recalculates the objects affected by that change.  Since it is demand-driven this update is very fast, even for very, very large images.  nip2 is very good at creating pipelines of image manipulation operations.  It is not very good for image editing tasks like touching up photographs.  For that, a tool like the GIMP should be used instead.",

Included are histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data interactively or in batch mode.\n\nThe command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++ interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.\n\nThe system has been designed in such a way that it can query its databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations or high-end PCs.

(https://arkanae.dev.java.net/)\n\nPlot:\n More than a thousand years ago, the three Gods that have created the\n world became too powerful for the poor mortals. Then the Elves forged\n three magical scepters to control the Gods, and the Gods were\n imprisoned in the magical crystal of Arkanae (during Arkanae I).\n Though the secret of the Elven blacksmiths has not been lost as time\n goes on, monsters and powers are coming back. New scepters have been\n reforged, giving birth to new Gods. But who can find the scepters and\n imprison them in the Arkanae, or free them for ever by dropping the\n scepters in the Abyss ? Who can judge the Gods ?\n You'll have to find your way through the 7 worlds : the Echassian\n village, the Pompon forest, the great cathedral, the ice desert, the\n Arkanae citadel, the Abyss swamp and finally the Elven Forge, to find\n the scepters and write a new destiny for the Universe !\n",

They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.\n\nA large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).",

This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web interface (xttpd).\n\nThe algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is used by the National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- data are required for every tidal prediction location.

Unison requires no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct socket connection.\n\nTransfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links.

It is highly modularized and exposes abstract interfaces, so that plugin modules with different functions can easily communicate with each other.  The currently supported module types are configuration, IM engine, front end, filter, and setup GUI.\n\nSCIM achieves the communication between IM engines and front ends through both shared library linking and server/client mode.  It supports XIM protocol, as well as GTK+ IM module and Qt IM module.\n\nThis package is the main binary package of SCIM.  It includes: the main program scim (GTK+ based) and other support programs; simple configuration module, X11 front end module, rawcode IM engine module, simplified/traditional Chinese conversion filter module, and their corresponding setup GUI modules; GTK+ panel and its setup GUI module; and a GTK+ based setup tool.\n\nSCIM is a well accepted platform and features various input method engines for many languages.  In Debian you can find the following separately packaged IMs useful: scim-tables-{additional,ja,ko,zh}, scim-pinyin, scim-uim, scim-m17n, scim-chewing, scim-anthy, scim-canna, scim-prime, and scim-skk.

The audio is limited to minimal but dynamic sound effects that change with game events and progress. It was designed as a casual but engaging and intelligent game for mobile phones.\n\nThe player places pairs of coloured tiles on a 7x7 grid. Tiles are cleared by surrounding one colour group with another colour group, scoring points. The cleared tiles change the colour of the surrounding colour group, allowing for chain reactions that give more points. More colours are added as more tiles have been placed on the grid and eventually the game will end when the grid fills up.\n\nPrimrose features a networked high score board with instant replay of the high scores, a comprehensive tutorial with animated examples, a colourblind mode, glowing, pulsating, retro graphics and synth-inspired sound effects.",

It manages your e-book collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to e-books in several formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen different e-book formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.\n\nSupported input formats are: MOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\n\nCalibre has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for different e-reader devices easy. At the moment, it has support for the SONY PRS 500/505/700 and the iPhone (with the stanza reader software). Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library and the creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in the library view. If an book has more than one format available, calibre automatically chooses the best format when uploading to the device.\n\nCalibre can automatically fetch news from a number of websites/RSS feeds, format the news into a e-book and upload to a connected device. There is support for generating LRF/EPUB e-books. The e-books include the *full* versions of the articles, not just the summaries.\n\nCalibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book formats.",

The construction languishes, though the expanse seems indifferent.\n\nOne night, in a dream, they appear: things that you clearly could not have conjured on your own. Not snowflakes. Not the self-similar forms of leaves. Not distant planets' erosion networks as viewed through telescopes. Not those things that are beautifully external but lack the signatures of consciousness. These things that appear are ugly and non-procedural: indecipherable transmissions bubbling up through static, faded messages floating in bottles, and charcoal handprints on cave walls.

You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.\n\nOnce 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping.

Perl statements can also be run, for example, as the action of a trigger, allowing you to do complex things. Some built-in functions of KildClient allow interaction with the world, such as sending commands to it.\n\nKildClient's ANSI support is extensive: it supports not only the common 16 colors, but also support underlined text (singly and doubly), text in italics, text striked through, reverse video and \"hidden\" text. It also supports vt100's line-drawing characters, and xterm's escape sequences for a 256-color mode. All these features make KildClient one of the clients with the most features for displaying the mud output.\n\nKildclient supports the MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol) protocol, versions 1 and 2, to reduce the necessary bandwidth.\n\nKildClient allows connection through SOCKS4/5 proxy servers.\n\nThis package contains the main program.

There may be a need to study operational manuals for the routes and trains chosen, rather than merely memorising a few keystrokes.\n\nThe simulator is designed to be backwards-compatible with existing 'BVE Trainsim' routes and cab interiors, allowing a wide range of existing scenarios to be loaded by a single-program (BVE1, BVE2, BVE4 and extended OpenBVE route formats).\n\nOpenBVE uses OpenGL for 3D graphics rendering, OpenAL for positional surround sound, and is written in the C# language.

Unison requires no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct socket connection.\n\nTransfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links.

This requires that audiovisual content and hypertext facilities be integrated, thanks to annotations providing explicit structures on  audiovisual streams, upon which hypervideo documents can be engineered.\n\nThe cross-platform Advene application allows users to easily create comments and analyses of video documents, through the definition of time-aligned annotations and their mobilisation into automatically-generated or user-written comment views (HTML documents). Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage, captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from the video itself.\n\nThe Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas; generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).",

It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.\n\nUnison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and synchronize between Windows and many UNIX platforms. Unison requires no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct socket connection.\n\nTransfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise specification, and is resilient to failure due to its careful handling of the replicas and its private structures.\n\nThis package adds the optional GTK+ interface.",

Since the modules use a common sequencer queue, they are automatically in sync with each other. QMidiArp works with an internal tick resolution of 192 ticks per beat. The queue can be synchronized to an incoming MIDI realtime clock or as a JACK transport client. Most of the relevant control elements are accessible via MIDI controller through a MIDI-learn infrastructure.

It can also interface with computer Go programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. Some sort of image converter is needed if you wish to use the utility provided to capture \"screen shots\" of a CGoban game. The CGoban homepage can be found at http://cgoban1.sourceforge.net/.\n\nGo is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).\n\nIn this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.\n\nThe game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.\n\nCompared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.\n\n(adopted from http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)",

Basically it's a tool to let you play with your GPS data after you get home from your trip.\n\nIt can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS receiver.\n\nSome example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.\n\nFurthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions. You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write these coordinates into the EXIF tags.",

These files eliminate the need to fetch headers from newsgroups as nzb files contain the message-ids of the segments which can be downloaded directly from most news servers. A technical description can be found at http://docs.newzbin2.es/index.php/Newzbin:NZB_Specs\n\nnzb makes Usenet downloading easy by providing an easy to use interface which loads up a specified nzb file and either downloads the files described in the nzb or streams the data to an external application. This is usually used for video files which results in streaming video over Usenet.",

You do this by \"grabbing\" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around, if need be, and \"throwing\" them back up.\n\nIf, when you throw some gems back up, you create a \"match\" of 3 or more gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion). At this point, if there are any \"matches\" of the same gem to the left or right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that disappear in a match.  (Matching four gives as many points as matching three twice, for example.)",

Instead, Gargoyle provides unified player.\n\nGargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys), *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic), *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS), *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or Supergl?s games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb archives, played with Frotz).\n\n(note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or the GNU Interactive Tools)\n\nGargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.\n\nTechnically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and images in a graphical Gtk window, with care on typography.\n\nLimitations:\n\n* This free version of gargoyle does not include the non-free Alan2 and Hugo interpreter (and use a different, free monospace font).\n\n* While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.\n\n* The TADS interpreter doesn't support HTML TADS; you can play the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.",

It also supports conversion from a dozen different e-book formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.\n\nSupported input formats are: MOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\n\nCalibre has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for different e-reader devices easy. At the moment, it has support for the SONY PRS 500/505/700 and the iPhone (with the stanza reader software). Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library and the creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in the library view. If an book has more than one format available, calibre automatically chooses the best format when uploading to the device.\n\nCalibre can automatically fetch news from a number of websites/RSS feeds, format the news into a e-book and upload to a connected device. There is support for generating LRF/EPUB e-books. The e-books include the *full* versions of the articles, not just the summaries.\n\nCalibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book formats.",

Rogues have no teammates (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot teammates and they do not have a team score.\n\nThere are two main styles of play: capture-the-flag and free-for-all. In capture-the-flag, each team (except rogues) has a team base and each team with at least one player has a team flag. The object is to capture an enemy team's flag by bringing it to your team's base. This destroys every player on the captured team, subtracts one from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score. In free-for-all, there are no team flags or team bases. The object is simply to get as high a score as possible.\n\nThis package installs the BZFlag client compatible with 2.4.x BZFlag servers.",
