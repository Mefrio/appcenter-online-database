Since the modules use a common sequencer queue, they are automatically in sync with each other. QMidiArp works with an internal tick resolution of 192 ticks per beat. The queue can be synchronized to an incoming MIDI realtime clock or as a JACK transport client. Most of the relevant control elements are accessible via MIDI controller through a MIDI-learn infrastructure. QMidiArp also has a log tool displaying the history of incoming MIDI events in colors depending on their type. QMidiArp is based on the Qt4 toolkit",

Included are histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data interactively or in batch mode.\n\nThe command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++ interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.\n\nThe system has been designed in such a way that it can query its databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data analysis systems.",

It is not based upon any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.\n\nSome of the things to look for in Openbox are:\n\n* ICCCM and EWMH compliance!\n* Very fast\n* Chainable key bindings\n* Customizable mouse actions\n* Window resistance\n* Multi-head Xinerama support!\n* Pipe menus\n",

Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.\n\nA large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).",

There may be a need to study operational manuals for the routes and trains chosen, rather than merely memorising a few keystrokes.\n\nThe simulator is designed to be backwards-compatible with existing 'BVE Trainsim' routes and cab interiors, allowing a wide range of existing scenarios to be loaded by a single-program (BVE1, BVE2, BVE4 and extended OpenBVE route formats).\n\nOpenBVE uses OpenGL for 3D graphics rendering, OpenAL for positional surround sound, and is written in the C# language.

You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.\n\nIn order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small chunks. (They're afraid of water, for no apparent reason. Ah well. \"The Matrix\" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.\n\nOnce 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than that, you'll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a. \"score\").\n\nSee also http://www.mattdm.org/icebreaker/",

    "description": "The Advene (Annotate DVd, Exchange on the NEt) project is aimed towards communities exchanging discourses (analysis, studies) about audiovisual documents (e.g. movies) in DVD format. This requires that audiovisual content and hypertext facilities be integrated, thanks to annotations providing explicit structures on  audiovisual streams, upon which hypervideo documents can be engineered.\n\nThe cross-platform Advene application allows users to easily create comments and analyses of video documents, through the definition of time-aligned annotations and their mobilisation into automatically-generated or user-written comment views (HTML documents). Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage, captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from the video itself.\n\nThe Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas; generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).",

It also supports conversion from a dozen different e-book formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the \"Convert E-books\" button.\n\nSupported input formats are: MOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS.\n\nCalibre has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for different e-reader devices easy. At the moment, it has support for the SONY PRS 500/505/700 and the iPhone (with the stanza reader software). Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library and the creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in the library view. If an book has more than one format available, calibre automatically chooses the best format when uploading to the device.\n\nCalibre can automatically fetch news from a number of websites/RSS feeds, format the news into a e-book and upload to a connected device. There is support for generating LRF/EPUB e-books. The e-books include the *full* versions of the articles, not just the summaries.\n\nCalibre has also a built-in e-book viewer that can display all the major e-book formats.",

    "description": "qGo is a computerized board on which you can play the game of Go against another player, view and edit smart-go files, and connect to Go servers on the internet. It can also interface with computer Go programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. The qGo homepage can be found at http://qgo.sourceforge.net/. Have a look at the cgoban package if you are interested in a Go client with less package dependencies.\n\nGo is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).\n\nIn this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.\n\nThe game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.\n\nCompared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.\n\n(adopted from http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)",

    "description": "Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio workstation (DAW).  It can be used to control, record, edit and run complex audio setups.\n\nArdour supports pro-audio interfaces through the ALSA project, which provides high quality, well designed device drivers and API's for audio I/O under Linux. Any interface supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many others.\n\nArdour has support for 24 bit samples using floating point internally, non-linear editing with unlimited undo, a user-configurable mixer, MTC master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware control surface compatibility.\n\nIt supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller and many modern digital mixers.\n\nArdour contains a powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is completely non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select, cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can save independent \"versions\" of a track or an entire piece\n\nArdour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another strip.\n\nArdour's channel capacity is limited only by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk subsystem to stream the data back and forth.\n\nJACK (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications and/or hardware audio interfaces.\n\nArdour is sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits, and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE floating point format.\n\nFurther information can be found at <http://ardour.org/>.",

It can also interface with computer Go programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. Some sort of image converter is needed if you wish to use the utility provided to capture \"screen shots\" of a CGoban game. The CGoban homepage can be found at http://cgoban1.sourceforge.net/.\n\nGo is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).\n\nIn this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.\n\nThe game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.\n\nCompared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.\n\n(adopted from http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)",

Angband has been in more or less continuous development since the early 1990s.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so, you will receive the exalted status of \"winner\" and your character may retire. To achieve this you will need to explore numerous dungeon levels, defeat many foes and sift through a great deal of treasure.\n\nAngband is a reference to Morgoth's \"prison of iron\" in the world of Middle-Earth, created by J.R.R. Tolkein.",

Many plugins exist, providing useful commands (bzrtools), graphical interfaces (qbzr), or native interaction with Subversion branches (bzr-svn).\n\nInstall python-paramiko if you are going to push branches to remote hosts with sftp, and python-pycurl if you'd like for SSL certificates always to be verified.",

Unison requires no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a direct socket connection.\n\nTransfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise specification, and is resilient to failure due to its careful handling of the replicas and its private structures.\n\nThis package adds the optional GTK+ interface.",

All these features make KildClient one of the clients with the most features for displaying the mud output.\n\nKildclient supports the MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol) protocol, versions 1 and 2, to reduce the necessary bandwidth.\n\nKildClient allows connection through SOCKS4/5 proxy servers.\n\nThis package contains the main program.

The name of these must be followed by an open parenthesis.\n  Ex : cos(3x), sqrt(x) and not cos 3x or sqrt x. On a given function,\n  others can be called, and so it's possible to associate or compose\n  functions.\n* Numerical sequence plotting, they can be defined by recurrent relation,\n or explicitly. On the recurrent definition, you can put as much first\n values as you need to.\n* Parametric equation plotting, with the possibility to use a second\n parameter, which is \"k\". The curves can be animated, with adjustable\n smoothness (frame rate) and speed (ms per step).\n* Parametric function and sequence plotting. The parameter to use is \"k\",\n once you put it on an function's expression, new widgets will appear\n on which you'll enter the range and the step of \"k\". You can also\n choose two colors and each curve would take a color between to two.\n* Draw tangents, they can be moved and resized simply with the mouse. * Draw derivatives and antiderivatives of functions. * Print the graph, with these options : **  Choose the basis scale in centimeters, so you can measure the graph\n   on the sheet with a ruler.\n**  Choose the size and the position of the graph on the sheet. **  Print in color or gray-scale. **  Export on a PDF file. * Exporting, it's possible to use all the known formats (png, jpeg,\n tiff, gif...).\n* Display a table of values, you can do it with three different options: **  From current graph view, the program will display the different\n   functions ,sequences and parametric equation values from the graph's\n   scale. And if you move the graph, the table would update itself\n   automatically.\n**  Manual, you choose a number of empty boxes, then you'll enter by\n   yourself the values that you want to know.\n**  Semi-automatic, with a given start value, step and number of values\n   to display.\n* Navigate on the graph : **  Select a curve to display the coordinates of its points. **  Zoom/unzoom on each axis separately or together, with the mouse\n   on a point, or on a rectangular region.\n**  Move the graph. * Customize the presentation : **  Change all the colors: axes, background, functions... **  Adjust curves displaying precision, it'll also affect rendering speed. **  Show/hide the grid. **  Activate/deactivate curves' smoothing. **  Display the graph on an orthonormal basis.",

Instead, Gargoyle provides unified player.\n\nGargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys), *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic), *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS), *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or Supergl?s games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb archives, played with Frotz).\n\n(note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or the GNU Interactive Tools)\n\nGargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.\n\nTechnically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and images in a graphical Gtk window, with care on typography.\n\nLimitations:\n\n* This free version of gargoyle does not include the non-free Alan2 and Hugo interpreter (and use a different, free monospace font).\n\n* While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.\n\n* The TADS interpreter doesn't support HTML TADS; you can play the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.",

Tiles are cleared by surrounding one colour group with another colour group, scoring points. The cleared tiles change the colour of the surrounding colour group, allowing for chain reactions that give more points. More colours are added as more tiles have been placed on the grid and eventually the game will end when the grid fills up.\n\nPrimrose features a networked high score board with instant replay of the high scores, a comprehensive tutorial with animated examples, a colourblind mode, glowing, pulsating, retro graphics and synth-inspired sound effects.",

Rogues have no teammates (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot teammates and they do not have a team score.\n\nThere are two main styles of play: capture-the-flag and free-for-all. In capture-the-flag, each team (except rogues) has a team base and each team with at least one player has a team flag. The object is to capture an enemy team's flag by bringing it to your team's base. This destroys every player on the captured team, subtracts one from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score. In free-for-all, there are no team flags or team bases.

Whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.\n\nThe core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.\n\nAdditionally, several thousand extension \"packages\" are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages, named 'r-cran-<name>'.\n\nThis package provides the core GNU R system from which only the optional documentation packages r-base-html, r-doc-html, r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info have been split off to somewhat reduce the size of this package.",

At this point, if there are any \"matches\" of the same gem to the left or right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for cool chain-reactions!

Therion is compatible with Survex, and centreline data can be stored in Survex or Therion form. If survex is installed it is used for loop closures. Centreline data and sketches can be imported from PocketTopo, allowing full paperless surveying.\n\nTeX and metapost are used to generate the images. libtk-img is needed to use scans in formats other than GIF and PNM (such as PNG and JPEG). Survex will be used for loop-closure if installed, but is not required.\n\nYou will need appropriate TeX language packages to process therion files which specify those character sets: Texlive-lang-czechslovak is needed to process the examples, and texlive-lang-cyrillic is also suggested.

The construction languishes, though the expanse seems indifferent.\n\nOne night, in a dream, they appear: things that you clearly could not have conjured on your own. Not snowflakes. Not the self-similar forms of leaves. Not distant planets' erosion networks as viewed through telescopes. Not those things that are beautifully external but lack the signatures of consciousness. These things that appear are ugly and non-procedural: indecipherable transmissions bubbling up through static, faded messages floating in bottles, and charcoal handprints on cave walls.

It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS receiver.\n\nSome example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.\n\nFurthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions. You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write these coordinates into the EXIF tags.",

The main advantage of the program is flexibility - parameters of peaks can be arbitrarily bound to each other, eg. the width of a peak can be an independent variable, can be the same as the width of another peak or can be given by a complicated - common to all peaks - formula.",
